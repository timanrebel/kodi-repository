# kodi-repository

Kodi repository for skins and plugins adapted for working on my X3

## Mimic XS

Skin adapted to the small screen of the X3. Running on a Raspberry PI via the Pibus board.

The included `Mimic.xs Skinbackup.zip` is a great set of defaults for this skin. Install the Skin Helper Skinbackup addon via the theme and put the zip in `~/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/script.skin.helper.skinbackup`.
